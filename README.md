# Highway-Racers-
## Project detials 
I wanted to develop a project using swift/xcode because I feel like my phone is where I interact with computer science the most on a daily basis. I did some research on simple games to make in swift and I eventually settled on a racing game where the user taps to move the car to avoid incoming traffic. I watched a few youtube videos on xcode’s built in game template and framework spritekit. I also researched swift’s physics mechanics. Most of the initialization and creation of the game scene was not too difficult, the hardest part was when it came to the app registering the users taps and then moving the car, however with the use of booleans I was able to get it to work successfully. Next I had to make the incoming traffic, I had to resize the photo of the cars so they were the same scale as the user car. Getting the traffic to move was also not hard however it was hard to have the user car disappear after hitting the incoming traffic. I had to do a lot of research on how to actually have the app register the physical contact, I eventually used booleans and it worked. Finally I added a score tracker to increase the score every second the usercar is still driving. That was not too difficult; it was simply a matter of adding a text box and then having it increase every second using a timer.
